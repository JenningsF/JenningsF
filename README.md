- I'm a US-based (CST) IT Professional, Software Engineer, and lifelong learner. Currently I am an IT Project Manager with [Cloud Ingenuity](https://www.cloudingenuity.com/).
- Currently I am working on setting up external access for my homelab via Traefik and optimizing via Ansible.
- Away from the keyboard I enjoy &#x1f4d6; reading &#x1f3b9; learning piano &#x1f3cb; weightlifting and &#x1f413; homesteading with my family.
